leetcode algorithms #4. Title: 两个排序数组的中位数.这题还没搞
<!--more-->

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be $O(\log{(m+n)})$.

Example 1:
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

Example 2:
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
