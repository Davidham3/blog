&gt;Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;首先是ill-posed problem，图像的不适定问题
法国数学家阿达马早在19世纪就提出了不适定问题的概念:称一个数学物理定解问题的解存在、唯一并且稳定的则称该问题是适定的（Well Posed）.如果不满足适定性概念中的上述判据中的一条或几条，称该问题是不适定的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="convolutional-neural-networks-for-super-resolution"&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks For Super-Resolution
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id="formulation"&gt;Formulation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We first upscale a single low-resolution image to the desired size using bicubic interpolation. Let us denote the interpolated image as $Y$. Our goal is to recover from $Y$ an image $F(Y)$ that is as similar as possible to the ground truth high-resolution image $X$. For the ease of presentation, we still call $Y$ a &amp;ldquo;low-resolution&amp;rdquo; image, although it has the same size as $X$. We wish to learning a mapping $F$, which conceptually consists of three operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patch extraction and representation. this operation extracts (overlapping) patches from the low-resolution image $Y$ and represents each patch as a high-dimensional vector. These vectors comprise a set of feature maps, of which the number equals to the dimensionality of the vectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-linear mapping. this operation nonlinearly maps each high-dimensional vector onto another high-dimensional vector. Each mapped vector is conceptually the representation of a high-resolution patch. These vectors comprise another set of feature maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconstruction. this operation aggregates the above high-resolution patch-wise representations to generate the final high-resolution image. This image is expected to be similar to the ground truth $X$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="patch-extraction-and-representation"&gt;Patch Extraction and Representation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A popular strategy in image restoration is to densely extract patches and then represent them by a set of pre-trained bases such as PCA, DCT, Haar, etc. This is equivalent to convolving the image by a set of filters, each of which is a basis. In our formulation, we involve the optimization of these bases into the optimization of the network. Formally, our first layer is expressed as an operation $F_1$:
&lt;/p&gt;
$$F\_1(Y)=max(0, W\_1 * Y + B\_1)$$&lt;p&gt;
where $W_1$ and $B_1$ represent the filters and biases respectively, and $*$ denotes the convolution operation. Here, $W_1$ corresponds to $n_1$ filters of support $c \times f_1 \times f_1$, where $c$ is the number of channels in the input image, $f_1$ is the spatial size of a filter. Intuitively, $W_1$ applies $n_1$ convolutions on the image, and each convolution has a kernel size $c \times f_1 \times f_1$. The output is composed of $n_1$ feature maps. $B_1$ is an $n_1$-dimensional vector, whose each element is associated with a filter. We apply the ReLU on the filter responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="non-linear-mapping"&gt;Non-Linear Mapping
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first layer extracts an $n_1$-dimensional feature for each patch. In the second operation, we map each of these $n_1$-dimensional vectors into an $n_2$-dimensional one. This is equivalent to applying $n_2$ filters which have a trivial spatial support $1 \times 1$. This interpretation is only valid for $1 \times 1$ filters. But it is easy to generalize to larger filters like $3 \times 3$ or $5 \times 5$. In that case, the non-linear mapping is not on a patch of the input image; instead, it is on a $3 \times 3$ or $5 \times 5$ &amp;ldquo;patch&amp;rdquo; of the feature map. The operation of the second layer is:
&lt;/p&gt;
$$F\_2(Y) = max(0, W\_2 * F\_1(Y) + B\_2)$$&lt;p&gt;
Here $W_2$ contains $n_2$ filters of size $n_1 \times f_2 \times f_2$, and $B_2$ is $n_2$-dimensional. Each of the output $n_2$-dimensional vectors is conceptually a representation of a high-resolution patch that will be used for reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="reconstruction"&gt;Reconstruction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the traditional methods, the predicted overlapping high-resolution patches are often averaged to produce the final full image. The averaging can be considered as a pre-defined filter on a set of feature maps (where each position is the &amp;ldquo;flattened&amp;rdquo; vector form of a high-resolution patch). Motivated by this, we define a convolutional layer to produce the final high-resolution image:
&lt;/p&gt;
$$F(Y)=W\_3 * F\_2(Y) + B\_3$$&lt;p&gt;
Here W_3 corresponds to $c$ filters of a size $n_2 \times f_3 \times f_3$, and $B_3$ is a $c$-dimensional vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="training"&gt;Training
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss function: given a set of high-resolution images ${X_i}$ and their corresponding low-resolution images ${Y_i}$, we use mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function:
&lt;/p&gt;
$$L(\Theta ) = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n\_{i=1}\Vert F(Y\_i;\Theta)-X\_i\Vert ^2$$&lt;p&gt;
where $n$ is the number of training samples. Using MSE as the loss function favors a high PSNR. The PSNR is widely-used metric for quantitatively evaluating image restoration quality, and is at least partially related to the perceptual quality. Despite that the proposed model is trained favoring a high PSNR, we still observe satisfactory performance when the model is evaluated using alternative evaluation metrics, e.g., SSIM, MSSIM.
PSNR: Peak Signal to Noise Ratio. 是一种评价图像的客观标准。
&lt;/p&gt;
$$PSNR = 10 \times \log\_{10}(\frac{(2^n-1)^2}{MSE})$$&lt;p&gt;
其中，MSE是原图像和处理图像之间的均方误差，n是每个采样值的比特数，单位是dB。
The loss is minimized using stochastic gradient descent with the standard backpropagation. In particular, the weight matrices are updated as
&lt;/p&gt;
$$\Delta\_{i+1}=0.9 \cdot \Delta\_i + \eta \cdot \frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{W^\ell\_i}}, W^\ell\_{i+1}=W^\ell\_{i}+\Delta\_{i+1}$$&lt;p&gt;
where $\ell \in {1,2,3}$ and $i$ are the indices of layers and iterations, $\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{W^\ell_i}}$ is the derivative. The filter weights of each layer are initialized by drawing randomly from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation 0.0001 (and 0 for biases). The learning rate is $10^{-4}$ for the first two layers, and $10^{-5}$ for the last layer. We empirically find that a smaller learning rate in the last layer is important for the network to converge (similar to the denoising case).
In the training phase, the ground truth images ${X_i}$ are prepared as $f_{sub} \times f_{sub} \times c$-pixel sub-images randomly cropped from the training images. By &amp;ldquo;sub-images&amp;rdquo; we mean these samples are treated as small &amp;ldquo;images&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;patches&amp;rdquo;, in the sense that &amp;ldquo;patches&amp;rdquo; are overlapping and require some averaging as post-processing but &amp;ldquo;sub-images&amp;rdquo; need not. To synthesize the low-resolution samples ${Y_i}$, we blur a sub-image by a Gaussian kernel, sub-sample it by the upscaling factor, and upscale it by the same factor via bicubic interpolation.
To avoid border effects during training, all the convolutional layers have no padding, and the network produces a smaller output $((f_{sub}-f_1-f_2-f_3+3)^2 \times c)$. The MSE loss function is evaluated only by the difference between the contral pixels of $X_i$ and the network output. Although we use a fixed image size in training, the convolutional nerual network can be applied on images of arbitrary sizes during testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution</title><link>https://davidham3.github.io/blog/p/perceptual-losses-for-real-time-style-transfer-and-super-resolution/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:01:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidham3.github.io/blog/p/perceptual-losses-for-real-time-style-transfer-and-super-resolution/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;ECCV 2016，实时风格迁移与超分辨率化的感知损失，这篇论文是在cs231n里面看到的，正好最近在研究风格迁移。一作是Justin Johnson，2017春的cs231n的主讲之一。这篇论文的主要内容是对Gatys等人的风格迁移在优化过程中进行了优化，大幅提升了性能。
主要原理就是，之前Gatys等人的论文是利用已经训练好的VGG19，求loss并利用VGG的结构反向求导更新图片。由于VGG结构复杂，这样反向更新速度很慢，改进方法是再另外设计一个神经网络，将内容图片作为输入，输出扔到VGG中做两个loss，然后反向传播更新当前这个神经网络的参数，这样训练出来的神经网络就可能将任意的内容图片扔进去，输出为风格迁移后的图片，这也就解决了速度的问题。这也就是将Feed-forward image transformation与style transfer结合在一起。原文链接：&lt;a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="image-transformation-network"&gt;Image Transformation Network
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id="architecture"&gt;Architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not use any pooling layers, instead using strided and fractionally strided convolutions for in-network downsampling and upsampling. Our network body consists of five residual blocks using the architecture of http://torch. ch/blog/2016/02/04/resnets.html. All non-residual convolutional layers are followed by spatial batch normalization and ReLU nonlinearities with the exception of the output layer, which instead uses a scaled tanh to ensure that the output image has pixels in the range [0, 255]. Other than the first and last layers with use $9 \times 9$ kernels, all convolutional layers use $3 \times 3$ kernels. The exact architectures of all our networks can be found in the supplementary material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="inputs-and-outputs"&gt;Inputs and Outputs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For style transfer the input and output are both color images of shape #3 \times 256 \times 256#.
For super-resolution with an upsampling factor of $f$, the output is a high-resolution patch of shape $3 \times 288/f \times 288/f$. Since the image transformation networks are fully-convolutional, at test-time they can be applied to images of any resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="downsampling-and-upsampling"&gt;Downsampling and Upsampling
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For super-resolution with an upsampling factor of $f$, we use several residual blocks followed by $log_2f$ convolutional layers with stride $1/2$. This is different from [1] who use bicubic interpolation to upsample the low-resolution input before passing it to the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our style transfer networks use the architecture shown in Table 1 and our super-resolution networks use the architecture shown in Table 2. In these tables &amp;ldquo;$C \times H \times W$ conv&amp;rdquo; denotes a convolutional layer with $C$ filters size $H \times W$ which is immeidately followed by spatial batch normalization [1] and a ReLU nonlinearity.
Our residual blocks each contain two $3 \times 3$ convolutional layers with the same number of filters on both layer. We use the residual block design of Gross and Wilber [2] (shown in Figure 1), which differs from that of He &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; [3] in that the ReLU nonlinearity following the addition is removed; this modified design was found in [2] to perform slightly better for image classification.
For style transfer, we found that standard zero-padded convolutions resulted in severe artifacts around the borders of the generated image. We therefore remove padding from the convolutions in residual blocks. A $3 \times 3$ convolution with no padding reduces the size of a feature map by 1 pixel on each side, so in this case the identity connection of the residual block performs a center crop on the input feature map. We also add spatial reflection padding to the beginning of the network so that the input and output of the network have the same size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="perceptual-loss-functions"&gt;Perceptual Loss Functions
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;We define two &lt;em&gt;perceptual loss functions&lt;/em&gt; that measure high-level perceptual and semantic differences between images. They make use of a loss &lt;em&gt;network&lt;/em&gt; $\phi$ pretrained for image classification, meaning that these perceptual loss functions are themselves deep convolutional neural networks. In all our experiments $\phi$ is the 16-layer VGG network pretrained on the ImageNet dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="featue-reconstruction-loss"&gt;Featue Reconstruction Loss
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than encouraging the pixels of the output image $\hat{y} = f_W(x)$ to exactly match the pixels of the target image $y$, we instead encourage them to have similar feature representations as computed by the loss network $\phi$. Let $\phi_j(x)$ be the activations of the &lt;em&gt;j&lt;/em&gt;th layer of the network $\phi$ when processing the image $x$; if $j$ is a convolutional layer then $\phi_j(x)$ will be a feature map of shape $C_j \times H_j \times W_j$. The &lt;em&gt;feature reconstruction loss&lt;/em&gt; is the (squared, normalized) Euclidean distance between feature representations:
&lt;/p&gt;
$$\ell\_{feat}^{\phi,j}(\hat{y}, y)=\frac{1}{C\_jH\_jW\_j}\Vert \phi\_j(\hat{y})-\phi\_j(y)\Vert\_2^2$$&lt;p&gt;
As demonstrated in [6] and reproduced in Figure 3, finding an image $\hat{y}$ that minimizes the feature reconstruction loss for early layers tends to produce images that are visually indistinguishable from $y$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="style-reconstruction-loss"&gt;Style Reconstruction Loss
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature reconstruction loss penalizes the output image $\hat{y}$ when it deviates in content from the target $y$. We also wish to penalize differences in style: colors, textures, common patterns, etc. To achieve this effect, Gatys &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; propose the following &lt;em&gt;style reconstruction loss&lt;/em&gt;.
As above, let $\phi_j(x)$ be the activations at the $j$th layer of the network $\phi$ for the input $x$, which is a feature map of shape $C_j \times H_j \times W_j$. Define the &lt;em&gt;Gram matrix&lt;/em&gt; $G^\phi_j(x)$ to be the $C_j \times C_j$ matrix whose elements are given by
&lt;/p&gt;
$$G^\phi\_j(x)\_{c,c'}=\frac{1}{C\_jH\_jW\_j}\sum^{H\_j}\_{h=1}\sum\_{w=1}^{W\_j}\phi\_j(x)\_{h,w,c}\phi\_j(x)\_{h,w,c'}$$&lt;h1 id="experiments"&gt;Experiments
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id="style-transfer"&gt;Style Transfer
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id="single-image-super_resolution"&gt;Single-Image Super_Resolution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an inherently ill-posed problem, since for each low-resolution image there exist multiple high-resolution images that could have generated it. The ambiguity becomes more extreme as the super-resolution factor grows; for larger factors ($\times 4$, $\times 8$), fine details of the high-resolution image may have little or no evidence in its low-resolution version.
To overcome this problem, we train super-resolution networks not with the per-pixel loss typically used [1] but instead with a feature reconstruction loss to allow transer of semantic knowledge from the pretrained loss network to the super-resolution network. We focus on $\times 4$ and $\times 8$ super-resolution since larger factors require more semantic reasoning about the input.
The traditional metrics used to evaluate super-resolution are PSNR and SSIM, both of which have been found to correlate poorly with human assessment of visual quality. PSNR and SSIM rely only on low-level differences between pixels and operate under the assumption of additive Gasussian noise, which may be invalid for super-resolution. In addition, PSNR is equivalent to the per-pixel loss $\mathcal{l_{pixle}}$, so as measured by PSNR a model trained to minimize feature reconstruction loss should always outperform a model trained to minimize feature reconstruction loss. We therefore emphasize that the goal of these experiments is not to achieve state-of-the art PSNR or SSIM results, but instead to showcase the qualitative difference between models trained with per-pixel and feature reconstruction losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="code"&gt;code

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;backward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;trainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;batch_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;training_loss&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;asscalar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;losses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;epoch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;training_loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;training.log&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;training_loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;plsr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save_params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;plsr.params&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;在实现的时候，超分辨率后需要一个后处理——直方图匹配，这里参考的是&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/mapbox/rio-hist/blob/master/rio_hist/match.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;rio-hist&lt;/a&gt;。
实验数据最开始用的是Microsoft的coco2017，将每张图随机截取$144 \times 144$像素的大小，然后使用宽度为1的高斯核进行模糊处理后，downsampling了一下，得到了$72 \times 72$的图片，作为网络的输入。后来发现效果不是很好，就打算向waifu2x一样，只训练动漫图片，上konachan上爬了一万张图，做同样的处理。此时的loss降到了31.

这是训练的最好的一次，最左侧是输入的模糊图片，第二列是网络的输出，第三列是做了直方图匹配得到的图片，第四列是ground truth。可以看到有很多小点点，我分析是tv loss占比太小的原因，当前tv loss乘以了0.1。于是将tv loss乘以0.5后又训练了一次，loss降到了58，结果如下：

感觉没法看了。。。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
